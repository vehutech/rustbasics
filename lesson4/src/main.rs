// Functions - The function main is the entry point. if you change it, you will encounter critical error.

// Every function begins with the reserved word fn which stands for function, the name of the function, followed by paranthesis then a code block.

// FUnction or variable names must be written in snake case - hello_world or kebab case -  hello-world

// Rust supports hoisting - a programming style in which function can be called from anywhere, even before its definition.

fn main(){
    hello_woorld();
}

fn hello_woorld(){
    println!("Helo Rust!");
}
